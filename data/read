## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

This project uses data from the **[Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)** competition hosted on Kaggle.

The dataset helps predict a clientâ€™s ability to repay a loan by analyzing historical data and previous application records. The key files used in this project are:

### ðŸ”¹ application_data.csv
- Refers to `application_train.csv` in the original dataset.
- Contains information about clients at the time of loan application.
- Includes demographic, financial, and employment-related details.
- The target variable is `TARGET` (1 = client defaulted, 0 = client repaid).

### ðŸ”¹ previous_application.csv
- Contains records of clientsâ€™ past loan applications (approved, refused, or canceled).
- Useful for understanding client behavior and risk patterns over time.

### ðŸ”¹ columns_description.csv
- Provides detailed descriptions of all variables in the dataset.
- Essential for understanding the meaning and context of each feature.
